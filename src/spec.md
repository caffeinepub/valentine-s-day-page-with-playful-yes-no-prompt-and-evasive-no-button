# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the “Yes” success state to show a specific love message and add a celebratory “lots of kisses” animation on success.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the success-state primary text shown after clicking “Yes” to exactly: "I love you Motu, Tu mera pyaara baccha h".
- Add a dense kiss-mark/lip-print particle shower animation that triggers after clicking “Yes”, animates (movement + fade/scale), and does not cause layout shifts or scrollbars.

**User-visible outcome:** After clicking “Yes”, the user sees the exact love message prominently and a fun, non-blocking shower of many animated kiss marks across the screen.
